          <p>I like writing code for my school CTE classes. I put most of my effort into schoolwork. Such a large portion of my effort into school that I took two Highschool courses before enrolling in my highschool. I take 1 AP Class and 4 Honors classes in my Freshman year.</p>

    <h3> 
      Service Hours
      </h3>

    <p class = "indent"> 
      In order to graduate from my Highschool, I need 20 service hours by the end of the year. Due to a certain pandemic, I've only been able to rack up two so far in the form of donatons. I can easilly cram in 20 hours though. There is an Elementary School right across the street from my highschool that looks like it has a lot of ungraded papers. I can volunteer over there afterschool and easilly rack in service hours. There are also nearby charity orginizations and soup kitchens which will be easy hours.
